<p>//Description: 学习《Linux网络编程（第二版）》一书时的一点笔记</p>

<h1 id="linux_network_programming_notes">Linux_Network_Programming_Notes</h1>

<p>实验环境： Ubuntu 16.04, g++</p>

<h2 id="441-pthreadc">4.4.1 pthread.c</h2>
<p>thread.cpp: In function ‘void* start_routine(void*)’:</p>

<p>thread.cpp:13:17: error: invalid conversion from ‘void<em>’ to ‘int</em>’ [-fpermissive]</p>

<p>int *running = arg;</p>

<p>-&gt; 需要显式转换(int*)arg</p>

<p>/usr/include/pthread.h:233:12: note:   initializing argument 3 of ‘int pthread_create(pthread_t<em>, const pthread_attr_t</em>, void* (<em>)(void</em>), void*)’
extern int pthread_create (pthread_t *__restrict __newthread,</p>

<p>-&gt; start_routine不用转换</p>

<p>thread.cpp:40:35: error: invalid conversion from ‘void<em>’ to ‘void**’ [-fpermissive]
  pthread_join(pt, (void</em>)&amp;ret_join);</p>

<p>-&gt;ret_join改为void *</p>

<p>thread.cpp:(.text+0x103): undefined reference to ‘pthread_create’</p>

<p>thread.cpp:(.text+0x171): undefined reference to ‘pthread_join’</p>

<p>-&gt; 需要加参数-lpthread,因为pthread库不是 Linux 系统默认的库， g++ thread.cpp -lpthread</p>
