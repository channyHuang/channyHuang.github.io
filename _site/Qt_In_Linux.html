<p>//Description: notes about how to publish qt execute files in linux machines without Qt</p>

<h1 id="normal-method">Normal Method</h1>
<h2 id="prepare-files">Prepare files</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Qt libraries
Qt plugins/platforms, put platforms, imageformats and others in the same folder with target files
other dependent files</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="set-environment-path">Set environment path</h2>
<p>in ~/username/.bashrc file, add in the end:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># libraries needed in qt execute files, here I put them in /media/sf_LaneGen/libs
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/media/sf_LaneGen/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# libraries of Qt
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/media/sf_LaneGen/libs/libQt5:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then do not forget to source .bashrc</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source .bashrc
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="run-target-execute-files">Run target execute files</h2>
<p>Here I catch another error, segmentation fault “已放弃 (核心已转储)”, but it can run normally in another machine which installed Qt.</p>

<p>The reason is that I build it with super permission, so it can’t be start normally without root permission.</p>

<p>here can set QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1 to debug which plugin cause such issue</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>export QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1
# run target execute file
./xxx 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h1 id="optimize-method">Optimize Method</h1>
<h2 id="write-install-files">Write install files</h2>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code></code></pre></div></div>
