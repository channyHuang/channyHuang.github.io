**Computer Vision**

>By the way, there won't be any theory in these notes, because I think that theory can be learned from books and others' blogs. There are so many blogs that have a deep description in algorithms, including the formulation, deduction, paper, thesis, etc. I won't write these in my articles unless I have different opinions or new ideas.

### Previous projects

2013.03~2017.03

Projects include:

1. **3D Reconstruction System Project. (2015.03 ~ 2017.03)**

Given a set of images and a rough model (for example, a human’s head, or a geometry). The target is to reconstruct the scene with adequate precision.

- IMU and vision fusion in order to obtain the pose of camera frames and point clouds of the scene.

- According to obtained point clouds to reconstruct mesh surface and repair it with a rough model as reference.

- Then, generate skeleton of target model and use this skeleton to guide refinement of mesh vertexes in order to minimize the distance of reconstructed mesh and reference mesh.

- Test the scheme and finish my master thesis in this subject

2. **Relighting After Reconstruction Project. (2014.07-2015.06)**

- Design a system to relight an object through adjust the light parameters and embed it into a new scene

- And automatically calculate the light direction and other parameters when given an image and the 3D model of the scene in that image

- Problem: the result is not accurate enough, in the following days I will try to improve it

3. **Server Log Data Visualization Project. (2013.03-2014.06)**

Given many server log data and make them visible.

- Research to analysis the data to recover some useful rules and show them in graphics

- Try to catch new types of terminals, predict new product specification

- Problem: data is so large that it takes a long time to show the result. Because of some reasons, this project has been put on hold.
